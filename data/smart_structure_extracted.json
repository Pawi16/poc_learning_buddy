    "content": "A DIZZYING ARRAY OF INTERNET END SYSTEMS\nNot too long ago, the end-system devices connected to the Internet were primarily\ntraditional computers such as desktop machines and powerful servers. Beginning in\nthe late 1990s and continuing today, a wide range of interesting devices are being\nconnected to the Internet, leveraging their ability to send and receive digital data.\nGiven the Internet’s ubiquity, its well-defined (standardized) protocols, and the\navailability of Internet-ready commodity hardware, it’s natural to use Internet tech-\nnology to network these devices together and to Internet-connected servers.\nMany of these devices are based in the home—video game consoles (e.g.,\nMicrosoft’s Xbox), Internet-ready televisions, digital picture frames that download\nand display digital pictures, washing machines, refrigerators, and even a toaster\nthat downloads meteorological information and burns an image of the day’s fore-\ncast (e.g., mixed clouds and sun) on your morning toast [BBC 2001]. IP-enabled\nphones with GPS capabilities put location-dependent services (maps, information\nabout nearby services or people) at your fingertips. Networked sensors embedded\ninto the physical environment allow monitoring of buildings, bridges, seismic activi-\nty, wildlife habitats, river estuaries, and the weather. Biomedical devices can be\nembedded and networked in a body-area network. With so many diverse devices\nbeing networked together, the Internet is indeed becoming an “Internet of things”\n[ITU 2005b].\n"
