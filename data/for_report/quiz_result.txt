MEDIUM QUIZ OUTPUT:
  [normal_multiple] Which of the following statements best describes a disadvantage of using the telescoping constructor pattern?
   (Type ID Verification: 'normal_multiple')
    a) It allows for easy creation and reading of client code.
    b) It can lead to inconsistent states during object construction.
    c) It is difficult to write and read client code when there are many parameters.
    d) It supports the creation of immutable objects easily.
  Correct Option: c
  Explanation: The telescoping constructor pattern becomes cumbersome as the number of parameters increases, making it difficult to write and read client code.       
------------------------------
  [statement_verification] Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding the Builder Pattern?
   (Type ID Verification: 'statement_verification')
    a) The Builder pattern allows for easy creation and modification of objects with many parameters.
    b) The Builder pattern does not support immutable object creation.
    c) The Builder pattern is less verbose than the telescoping constructor pattern.
    d) The Builder pattern cannot be used in class hierarchies.
  Correct Option: a
  Explanation: The Builder pattern provides a fluent API for creating objects with many parameters and supports immutable object creation.

HARD QUIZ OUTPUT:
  [statement_counting] Consider the following statements regarding Builder Pattern:
I. The simulated self-type idiom allows for proper method chaining without needing casts.
II. In a performance-critical situation, the overhead of creating a builder might be noticeable and problematic.
III. A disadvantage of starting with constructors or static factories is that they become obsolete when switching to a builder pattern later on.
IV. The Builder pattern can automatically fill in some fields upon object creation, such as incrementing serial numbers.  
   (Type ID Verification: 'statement_counting')
    a) 0
    b) 1
    c) 2
    d) 3
    e) 4
  Correct Option: d
  Explanation: Statement I is true, as the simulated self-type idiom allows for proper method chaining without casts. Statement II is also true; creating a builder might be problematic in performance-critical situations due to overhead costs. Statement III is true because obsolete constructors or static factories will stick out when switching to a builder pattern later on. Statement IV is true, as mentioned that builders can fill in some fields automatically upon object creation.
