Given that the Internet\nis so large and has so many diverse components and uses, is there any hope of\nunderstanding how it works? Are there guiding principles and structure that can pro-\nvide a foundation for understanding such an amazingly large and complex system?\nAnd if so, is it possible that it actually could be both interesting and fun to learn\nabout computer networks? Fortunately, the answers to all of these questions is a\nresounding YES! Indeed, it’s our aim in this book to provide you with a modern\nintroduction to the dynamic field of computer networking, giving you the principles\nand practical insights you’ll need to understand not only today’s networks, but\ntomorrow’s as well.\nThis first chapter presents a broad overview of computer networking and the\nInternet. Our goal here is to paint a broad picture and set the context for the rest of\nthis book, to see the forest through the trees. We’ll cover a lot of ground in this intro-\nductory chapter and discuss a lot of the pieces of a computer network, without los-\ning sight of the big picture.\nWe’ll structure our overview of computer networks in this chapter as follows.\nAfter introducing some basic terminology and concepts, we’ll first examine the\nbasic hardware and software components that make up a network. We’ll begin at\nthe network’s edge and look at the end systems and network applications running\nin the network. We’ll then explore the core of a computer network, examining the\nlinks and the switches that transport data, as well as the access networks and phys-\nical media that connect end systems to the network core. We’ll learn that the Inter-\nnet is a network of networks, and we’ll learn how these networks connect with\neach other.\nAfter having completed this overview of the edge and core of a computer net-\nwork, we’ll take the broader and more abstract view in the second half of this chap-\nter. We’ll examine delay, loss, and throughput of data in a computer network and\nprovide simple quantitative models for end-to-end throughput and delay: models\nthat take into account transmission, propagation, and queuing delays. We’ll then\nintroduce some of the key architectural principles in computer networking, namely,\nprotocol layering and service models. We’ll also learn that computer networks are\nvulnerable to many different types of attacks; we’ll survey some of these attacks and\nconsider how computer networks can be made more secure. Finally, we’ll close this\nchapter with a brief history of computer networking.\n"

    "title": "1.1 What Is the Internet?",
    "content": "In this book, we’ll use the public Internet, a specific computer network, as our prin-\ncipal vehicle for discussing computer networks and their protocols. But what is the\nInternet? There are a couple of ways to answer this question. First, we can describe\nthe nuts and bolts of the Internet, that is, the basic hardware and software components\nthat make up the Internet. Second, we can describe the Internet in terms of a net-\nworking infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications. Let’s begin\nwith the nuts-and-bolts description, using Figure 1.1to illustrate our discussion.\n1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description\nThe Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of com-\nputing devices throughout the world. Not too long ago, these computing devices were\nprimarily traditional desktop PCs, Linux workstations, and so-called servers that store\nand transmit information such as Web pages and e-mail messages. Increasingly,\nhowever, nontraditional Internet end systems such as laptops, smartphones, tablets,\nTVs, gaming consoles, Web cams, automobiles, environmental sensing devices,\npicture frames, and home electrical and security systems are being connected to the\nInternet. Indeed, the term computer network is beginning to sound a bit dated, given\nthe many nontraditional devices that are being hooked up to the Internet. In Internet jar-\ngon, all of these devices are called hosts or end systems . As of July 2011, there were\n2 CHAPTER 1 • COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET\n1.1 • WHAT IS THE INTERNET? 3\nFigure 1.1 (cid:2) Some pieces of the Internet\nKey:\nHost\n(= end system)\nServer Mobile Router Link-Layer\nswitch\nModem Base\nstation\nSmartphone Cell phone\ntower\nNational or\nGlobal ISP\nMobile Network\nLocal or\nRegional ISP\nEnterprise Network\nHome Network\nnearly 850 million end systems attached to the Internet [ISC 2012], not counting\nsmartphones, laptops, and other devices that are only intermittently connected to the\nInternet.Overall, more there are an estimated 2 billion Internet users [ITU 2011].\nEnd systems are connected together by a network of communication links and\npacket switches . We’ll see in Section 1.2 that there are many types of communica-\ntion links, which are made up of different types of physical media, including coaxial\ncable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit\ndata at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second.\nWhen one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end sys-\ntem segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting pack-\nages of information, known as packets in the jargon of computer networks, are then\nsent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled\ninto the original data.\nApacket switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication\nlinks and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Packet\nswitches come in many shapes and flavors, but the two most prominent types in\ntoday’s Internet are routers and link-layerswitches . Both types of switches for-\nward packets toward their ultimate destinations. Link-layer switches are typically\nused in access networks, while routers are typically used in the network core. The\nsequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from\nthe sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path\nthrough the network. The exact amount of traffic being carried in the Internet is\ndifficult to estimate but Cisco [Cisco VNI 2011] estimates global Internet traffic will\nbe nearly 40 exabytes per month in 2012.\nPacket-switched networks (which transport packets) are in many ways simi-\nlar to transportation networks of highways, roads, and intersections (which trans-\nport vehicles). Consider, for example, a factory that needs to move a large\namount of cargo to some destination warehouse located thousands of kilometers\naway. At the factory, the cargo is segmented and loaded into a fleet of trucks.\nEach of the trucks then independently travels through the network of highways,\nroads, and intersections to the destination warehouse. At the destination ware-\nhouse, the cargo is unloaded and grouped with the rest of the cargo arriving from\nthe same shipment. Thus, in many ways, packets are analogous to trucks, com-\nmunication links are analogous to highways and roads, packet switches are anal-\nogous to intersections, and end systems are analogous to buildings. Just as a truck\ntakes a path through the transportation network, a packet takes a path through a\ncomputer network.\nEnd systems access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs) ,\nincluding residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate\nISPs; university ISPs; and ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee\nshops, and other public places. Each ISPis in itself a network of packet switches\nand communication links. ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the\nend systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL,\n4 CHAPTER 1 • COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET\nhigh-speed local area network access, wireless access, and 56 kbps dial-up modem\naccess. ISPs also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting Web\nsites directly to the Internet. The Internet is all about connecting end systems to\neach other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be intercon-\nnected. These lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and interna-\ntional upper-tier ISPs such as Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Sprint, and NTT.\nAn upper-tier ISPconsists of high-speed routers interconnected with high-speed\nfiber-optic links. Each ISPnetwork, whether upper-tier or lower-tier, is managed\nindependently, runs the IPprotocol (see below), and conforms to certain naming\nand address conventions. We’ll examine ISPs and their interconnection more\nclosely in Section 1.3.\nEnd systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run protocols\nthat control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) are two of\nthe most important protocols in the Internet. The IPprotocol specifies the format of\nthe packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems. The Internet’s\nprincipal protocols are collectively known as TCP/IP . We’ll begin looking into pro-\ntocols in this introductory chapter. But that’s just a start—much of this book is con-\ncerned with computer network protocols!\nGiven the importance of protocols to the Internet, it’s important that everyone\nagree on what each and every protocol does, so that people can create systems and\nproducts that interoperate. This is where standards come into play. Internet stan-\ndards are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)[IETF 2012].\nThe IETF standards documents are called requests forcomments (RFCs) . RFCs\nstarted out as general requests for comments (hence the name) to resolve network\nand protocol design problems that faced the precursor to the Internet [Allman 2011].\nRFCs tend to be quite technical and detailed. They define protocols such as TCP, IP,\nHTTP(for the Web), and SMTP(for e-mail). There are currently more than 6,000\nRFCs. Other bodies also specify standards for network components, most notably\nfor network links. The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee [IEEE 802\n2012], for example, specifies the Ethernet and wireless WiFi standards.\n1.1.2 A Services Description\nOur discussion above has identified many of the pieces that make up the Internet.\nBut we can also describe the Internet from an entirely different angle—namely, as\nan infrastructure that provides services to applications . These applications\ninclude electronic mail, Web surfing, social networks, instant messaging, Voice-\nover-IP(VoIP), video streaming, distributed games, peer-to-peer (P2P) file shar-\ning, television over the Internet, remote login, and much, much more. The\napplications are said to be distributed applications ,since they involve multiple\nend systems that exchange data with each other. Importantly, Internet applications\n1.1 • WHAT IS THE INTERNET? 5\nrun on end systems—they do not run in the packet switches in the network core.\nAlthough packet switches facilitate the exchange of data among end systems, they\nare not concerned with the application that is the source or sink of data.\nLet’s explore a little more what we mean by an infrastructure that provides\nservices to applications. To this end, suppose you have an exciting new idea for a\ndistributed Internet application, one that may greatly benefit humanity or one that\nmay simply make you rich and famous. How might you go about transforming\nthis idea into an actual Internet application? Because applications run on end sys-\ntems, you are going to need to write programs that run on the end systems. You\nmight, for example, write your programs in Java, C, or Python. Now, because you\nare developing a distributed Internet application, the programs running on the\ndifferent end systems will need to send data to each other. And here we get to a\ncentral issue—one that leads to the alternative way of describing the Internet as a\nplatform for applications. How does one program running on one end system\ninstruct the Internet to deliver data to another program running on another end\nsystem?\nEnd systems attached to the Internet provide an Application Programming\nInterface (API) that specifies how a program running on one end system asks\nthe Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program run-\nning on another end system. This Internet API is a set of rules that the sending\nprogram must follow so that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination\nprogram. We’ll discuss the Internet API in detail in Chapter 2. For now, let’s\ndraw upon a simple analogy, one that we will frequently use in this book. Sup-\npose Alice wants to send a letter to Bob using the postal service. Alice, of course,\ncan’t just write the letter (the data) and drop the letter out her window. Instead,\nthe postal service requires that Alice put the letter in an envelope; write Bob’s\nfull name, address, and zip code in the center of the envelope; seal the envelope;\nput a stamp in the upper-right-hand corner of the envelope; and finally, drop the\nenvelope into an official postal service mailbox. Thus, the postal service has its\nown “postal service API,” or set of rules, that Alice must follow to have the\npostal service deliver her letter to Bob. In a similar manner, the Internet has an\nAPI that the program sending data must follow to have the Internet deliver the\ndata to the program that will receive the data.\nThe postal service, of course, provides more than one service to its customers.\nIt provides express delivery, reception confirmation, ordinary use, and many more\nservices. In a similar manner, the Internet provides multiple services to its applica-\ntions. When you develop an Internet application, you too must choose one of the\nInternet’s services for your application. We’ll describe the Internet’s services in\nChapter 2.\nWe have just given two descriptions of the Internet; one in terms of its hardware\nand software components, the other in terms of an infrastructure for providing\nservices to distributed applications. But perhaps you are still confused as to what the\n6 CHAPTER 1 • COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET\nInternet is. What are packet switching and TCP/IP? What are routers? What kinds of\ncommunication links are present in the Internet? What is a distributed application?\nHow can a toaster or a weather sensor be attached to the Internet? If you feel a bit\noverwhelmed by all of this now, don’t worry—the purpose of this book is to intro-\nduce you to both the nuts and bolts of the Internet and the principles that govern how\nand why it works. We’ll explain these important terms and questions in the follow-\ning sections and chapters.\n1.1.3 What Is a Protocol?\nNow that we’ve got a bit of a feel for what the Internet is, let’s consider another\nimportant buzzword in computer networking: protocol . What is a protocol? What\ndoes a protocol do ?\nA Human Analogy\nIt is probably easiest to understand the notion of a computer network protocol by\nfirst considering some human analogies, since we humans execute protocols all of\nthe time. Consider what you do when you want to ask someone for the time of day.\nAtypical exchange is shown in Figure 1.2. Human protocol (or good manners, at\nleast) dictates that one first offer a greeting (the first “Hi” in Figure 1.2) to initiate\ncommunication with someone else. The typical response to a “Hi” is a returned\n“Hi” message. Implicitly, one then takes a cordial “Hi” response as an indication\nthat one can proceed and ask for the time of day. Adifferent response to the initial\n“Hi” (such as “Don’t bother me!” or “I don’t speak English,” or some unprintable\nreply) might indicate an unwillingness or inability to communicate. In this case,\nthe human protocol would be not to ask for the time of day. Sometimes one gets no\nresponse at all to a question, in which case one typically gives up asking that per-\nson for the time. Note that in our human protocol, there are specific messages we\nsend, and specific actions we take in response to the received reply messages or\nother events (such as no reply within some given amount of time). Clearly, trans-\nmitted and received messages, and actions taken when these messages are sent or\nreceived or other events occur, play a central role in a human protocol. If people\nrun different protocols (for example, if one person has manners but the other does\nnot, or if one understands the concept of time and the other does not) the protocols\ndo not interoperate and no useful work can be accomplished. The same is true in\nnetworking—it takes two (or more) communicating entities running the same pro-\ntocol in order to accomplish a task.\nLet’s consider a second human analogy. Suppose you’re in a college class (a\ncomputer networking class, for example!). The teacher is droning on about proto-\ncols and you’re confused. The teacher stops to ask, “Are there any questions?” (a\n1.1 • WHAT IS THE INTERNET? 7\nmessage that is transmitted to, and received by, all students who are not sleeping).\nYou raise your hand (transmitting an implicit message to the teacher). Your teacher\nacknowledges you with a smile, saying “Yes . . .” (a transmitted message encourag-\ning you to ask your question—teachers love to be asked questions), and you then ask\nyour question (that is, transmit your message to your teacher). Your teacher hears\nyour question (receives your question message) and answers (transmits a reply to\nyou). Once again, we see that the transmission and receipt of messages, and a set of\nconventional actions taken when these messages are sent and received, are at the\nheart of this question-and-answer protocol.\nNetwork Protocols\nAnetwork protocol is similar to a human protocol, except that the entities exchang-\ning messages and taking actions are hardware or software components of some\ndevice (for example, computer, smartphone, tablet, router, or other network-capable\n8 CHAPTER 1 • COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET\nG E T h t t p : / / w w w . a w l . c o m / k u r o s e - r o s s\nT C P c o n n e c t i o n r e q u e s t\nTime Time\nT C P c o n n e c t i o n r e p l y\n< f i l e >\nH i\nG o t t h e t i m e ?\nTime Time\nH i\n2 : 0 0\nFigure 1.2 (cid:2) A human protocol and a computer network protocol\ndevice). All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote\nentities is governed by a protocol. For example, hardware-implemented protocols in\ntwo physically connected computers control the flow of bits on the “wire” between\nthe two network interface cards; congestion-control protocols in end systems con-\ntrol the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver; protocols\nin routers determine a packet’s path from source to destination. Protocols are run-\nning everywhere in the Internet, and consequently much of this book is about com-\nputer network protocols.\nAs an example of a computer network protocol with which you are probably\nfamiliar, consider what happens when you make a request to a Web server, that is,\nwhen you type the URLof a Web page into your Web browser. The scenario is illus-\ntrated in the right half of Figure 1.2. First, your computer will send a connection\nrequest message to the Web server and wait for a reply. The Web server will eventu-\nally receive your connection request message and return a connection reply mes-\nsage. Knowing that it is now OK to request the Web document, your computer then\nsends the name of the Web page it wants to fetch from that Web server in a GET\nmessage. Finally, the Web server returns the Web page (file) to your computer.\nGiven the human and networking examples above, the exchange of messages\nand the actions taken when these messages are sent and received are the key defin-\ning elements of a protocol:\nAprotocoldefines the format and the order of messages exchanged between\ntwo or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the trans-\nmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.\nThe Internet, and computer networks in general, make extensive use of proto-\ncols. Different protocols are used to accomplish different communication tasks. As\nyou read through this book, you will learn that some protocols are simple and\nstraightforward, while others are complex and intellectually deep. Mastering the\nfield of computer networking is equivalent to understanding the what, why, and how\nof networking protocols.\n"

    "title": "1.2 The Network Edge",
    "content": "In the previous section we presented a high-level overview of the Internet and net-\nworking protocols. We are now going to delve a bit more deeply into the compo-\nnents of a computer network (and the Internet, in particular). We begin in this\nsection at the edge of a network and look at the components with which we are most\nfamiliar—namely, the computers, smartphones and other devices that we use on a\ndaily basis. In the next section we’ll move from the network edge to the network\ncore and examine switching and routing in computer networks.\n1.2 • THE NETWORK EDGE 9\nRecall from the previous section that in computer networking jargon, the com-\nputers and other devices connected to the Internet are often referred to as end sys-\ntems. They are referred to as end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet,\nas shown in Figure 1.3. The Internet’s end systems include desktop computers (e.g.,\ndesktop PCs, Macs, and Linux boxes), servers (e.g., Web and e-mail servers), and\nmobile computers (e.g., laptops, smartphones, and tablets). Furthermore, an increas-\ning number of non-traditional devices are being attached to the Internet as end sys-\ntems (see sidebar).\nEnd systems are also referred to as hosts because they host (that is, run) appli-\ncation programs such as a Web browser program, a Web server program, an e-mail\nclient program, or an e-mail server program. Throughout this book we will use the\nterms hosts and end systems interchangeably; that is, host = end system . Hosts are\nsometimes further divided into two categories: clients and servers . Informally,\nclients tend to be desktop and mobile PCs, smartphones, and so on, whereas servers\ntend to be more powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, stream\nvideo, relay e-mail, and so on. Today, most of the servers from which we receive\n10 CHAPTER 1 • COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET\nA DIZZYING ARRAY OF INTERNET END SYSTEMS\nNot too long ago, the end-system devices connected to the Internet were primarily\ntraditional computers such as desktop machines and powerful servers. Beginning in\nthe late 1990s and continuing today, a wide range of interesting devices are being\nconnected to the Internet, leveraging their ability to send and receive digital data.\nGiven the Internet’s ubiquity, its well-defined (standardized) protocols, and the\navailability of Internet-ready commodity hardware, it’s natural to use Internet tech-\nnology to network these devices together and to Internet-connected servers.\nMany of these devices are based in the home—video game consoles (e.g.,\nMicrosoft’s Xbox), Internet-ready televisions, digital picture frames that download\nand display digital pictures, washing machines, refrigerators, and even a toaster\nthat downloads meteorological information and burns an image of the day’s fore-\ncast (e.g., mixed clouds and sun) on your morning toast [BBC 2001]. IP-enabled\nphones with GPS capabilities put location-dependent services (maps, information\nabout nearby services or people) at your fingertips. Networked sensors embedded\ninto the physical environment allow monitoring of buildings, bridges, seismic activi-\nty, wildlife habitats, river estuaries, and the weather. Biomedical devices can be\nembedded and networked in a body-area network. With so many diverse devices\nbeing networked together, the Internet is indeed becoming an “Internet of things”\n[ITU 2005b].\nCASE HISTORY\nsearch results, e-mail, Web pages, and videos reside in large data centers . For\nexample, Google has 30–50 data centers, with many having more than one hundred\nthousand servers.\nMobile Network\nNational or\nGlobal ISP\nLocal or\nRegional ISP\nEnterprise Network\nHome Network\nFigure 1.3 (cid:2) End-system interaction\n1.2 • THE NETWORK EDGE 11\n12 CHAPTER 1 • COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET\nNational or\nGlobal ISP\nMobile Network\nLocal or\nRegional ISP\nEnterprise Network\nHome Network\nFigure 1.4 (cid:2) Access networks\n1.2.1 Access Networks\nHaving considered the applications and end systems at the “edge of the network,”\nlet’s next consider the access network—the network that physically connects an end\nsystem to the first router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end\nsystem to any other distant end system. Figure 1.4 shows several types of access\nnetworks with thick, shaded lines, and the settings (home, enterprise, and wide-area\nmobile wireless) in which they are used.\nHome Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up, and Satellite\nIn developed countries today, more than 65 percent of the households have Internet\naccess, with Korea, Netherlands, Finland, and Sweden leading the way with more than\n80 percent of households having Internet access, almost all via a high-speed broadband\nconnection [ITU 2011]. Finland and Spain have recently declared high-speed Internet\naccess to be a “legal right.” Given this intense interest in home access, let’s begin our\noverview of access networks by considering how homes connect to the Internet.\nToday, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are digital\nsubscriberline (DSL) and cable. Aresidence typically obtains DSLInternet access\nfrom the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone\naccess. Thus, when DSL is used, a customer’s telco is also its ISP. As shown in\nFigure 1.5, each customer’s DSLmodem uses the existing telephone line (twisted-\npair copper wire, which we’ll discuss in Section 1.2.2) to exchange data with a digi-\ntal subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the telco’s local central\noffice (CO). The home’s DSLmodem takes digital data and translates it to high-\nfrequency tones for transmission over telephone wires to the CO; the analog signals\nfrom many such houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM.\nThe residential telephone line carries both data and traditional telephone sig-\nnals simultaneously, which are encoded at different frequencies:\n• Ahigh-speed downstream channel, in the 50 kHz to 1 MHz band\n• Amedium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 kHz to 50 kHz band\n• An ordinary two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 kHz band\nThis approach makes the single DSL link appear as if there were three separate\nlinks, so that a telephone call and an Internet connection can share the DSLlink at\nthe same time. (We’ll describe this technique of frequency-division multiplexing in\nHome PC\nHome\nphone\nDSL\nmodem\nInternet\nTelephone\nnetwork\nSplitter\nExisting phone line:\n0-4KHz phone; 4-50KHz\nupstream data; 50KHz–\n1MHz downstream data\nCentral\noffice\nDSLAM\nFigure 1.5 (cid:2) DSL Internet access\n1.2 • THE NETWORK EDGE 13\n14 CHAPTER 1 • COMPUTER NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET\nSection 1.3.1). On the customer side, a splitter separates the data and telephone sig-\nnals arriving to the home and forwards the data signal to the DSLmodem. On the\ntelco side, in the CO, the DSLAM separates the data and phone signals and sends\nthe data into the Internet. Hundreds or even thousands of households connect to a\nsingle DSLAM [Dischinger 2007].\nThe DSL standards define transmission rates of 12 Mbps downstream and\n1.8 Mbps upstream [ITU 1999], and 24 Mbps downstream and 2.5 Mbps upstream\n[ITU 2003]. Because the downstream and upstream rates are different, the access is\nsaid to be asymmetric. The actual downstream and upstream transmission rates\nachieved may be less than the rates noted above, as the DSLprovider may purpose-\nfully limit a residential rate when tiered service (different rates, available at differ-\nent prices) are offered, or because the maximum rate can be limited by the distance\nbetween the home and the CO, the gauge of the twisted-pair line and the degree of\nelectrical interference. Engineers have expressly designed DSLfor short distances\nbetween the home and the CO; generally, if the residence is not located within 5 to 10\nmiles of the CO, the residence must resort to an alternative form of Internet access.\nWhile DSLmakes use of the telco’s existing local telephone infrastructure,\ncable Internet access makes use of the cable television company’s existing cable\ntelevision infrastructure. Aresidence obtains cable Internet access from the same\ncompany that provides its cable television. As illustrated in Figure 1.6, fiber optics\nconnect the cable head end to neighborhood-level junctions, from which tradi-\ntional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual houses and apartments. Each\nneighborhood junction typically supports 500 to 5,000 homes. Because both fiber\nand coaxial cable are employed in this system, it is often referred to as hybrid\nfiber coax (HFC).\nFiber\ncable\nCoaxial cable\nHundreds\nof homes\nCable head end\nHundreds\nof homes\nFiber\nnode\nFiber\nnode\nInternet\nCMTS\nFigure 1.6 (cid:2) A hybrid fiber-coaxial access network\nCable internet access requires special modems, called cable modems. As with a\nDSLmodem, the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to the\nhome PC through an Ethernet port. (We will discuss Ethernet in great detail in\nChapter 5.) At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS)\nserves a similar function as the DSLnetwork’s DSLAM—turning the analog signal\nsent from the cable modems in many downstream homes back into digital format.\nCable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an\nupstream channel. As with DSL, access is typically asymmetric, with the down-\nstream channel typically allocated a higher transmission rate than the upstream\nchannel. The DOCSIS 2.0 standard defines downstream rates up to 42.8 Mbps and\nupstream rates of up to 30.7 Mbps. As in the case of DSLnetworks, the maximum\nachievable rate may not be realized due to lower contracted data rates or media\nimpairments.\nOne important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared\nbroadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the head end travels down-\nstream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the\nupstream channel to the head end. For this reason, if several users are simultane-\nously downloading a video file on the downstream channel, the actual rate at which\neach user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable\ndownstream rate. On the other hand, if there are only a few active users and they\nare all Web surfing, then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the\nfull cable downstream rate, because the users will rarely request a Web page at\nexactly the same time. Because the upstream channel is also shared, a distributed\nmultiple access protocol is needed to coordinate transmissions and avoid collisions.\n(We’ll discuss this collision issue in some detail in Chapter 5.)\nAlthough DSLand cable networks currently represent more than 90 percent of\nresidential broadband access in the United States, an up-and-coming technology that\npromises even higher speeds is the deployment of fiber to the home (FTTH)\n[FTTH Council 2011a]. As the name suggests, the FTTH concept is simple—\nprovide an optical fiber path from the CO directly to the home. In the United States,\nVerizon has been particularly aggressive with FTTH with its FIOS service [Verizon\nFIOS 2012].\nThere are several competing technologies for optical distribution from the\nCO to the homes. The simplest optical distribution network is called direct fiber,\nwith one fiber leaving the CO for each home. More commonly, each fiber leav-\ning the central office is actually shared by many homes; it is not until the fiber\ngets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer-specific\nfibers. There are two competing optical-distribution network architectures that\nperform this splitting: active optical networks (AONs) and passive optical net-\nworks (PONs). AON is essentially switched Ethernet, which is discussed in\nChapter 5.\nHere, we briefly discuss PON, which is used in Verizon’s FIOS service.\nFigure 1.7shows FTTH using the PON distribution architecture. Each home has\n1.2 • THE NETWORK EDGE 15\n"
