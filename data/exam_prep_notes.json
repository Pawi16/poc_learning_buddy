Circuit switching, on the other hand, establishes a dedicated connection between two nodes before transmitting data.\n\n• **Pros of Packet Switching:*\n  • Offers better sharing of transmission capacity than circuit switching.\n  • Simpler, more efficient, and less costly to implement than circuit switching.\n\n• **Cons of Packet Switching:*\n  • Critics argue that packet switching is not suitable for real-time services due to variable and unpredictable end-to-end delays.\n\n• **Process:** In packet switching, the probability of having multiple active users is low. When there are fewer active users, packets flow through the link without delay, similar to circuit switching. However, when more than 10 users are active, the output queue grows until the aggregate input rate falls below the link's capacity.\n\n• **Comparison:** Packet switching provides better sharing of transmission capacity and is simpler to implement than circuit switching. Circuit switching pre-allocates use of the transmission link regardless of demand, while packet switching allocates link use on demand.\n\n• **Trend:** The trend has been in favor of packet switching, with many telephone networks migrating towards it.",

        "note_content": "• **ARPAnet**: Initial single, closed network that required physical attachment to another ARPAnet IMP for communication.\n• **ALOHANet**, **DARPA's packet-satellite** and **packet-radio networks**, **Telenet**, **Cyclades**, and other stand-alone packet-switching networks emerged in the early to mid-1970s.\n• **TCP**: Developed by Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, TCP combined reliable in-sequence delivery with forwarding functions. Early versions of TCP were different from today's TCP.\n• **UDP**: Separated out of TCP due to recognition of importance for unreliable, non-flow-controlled, end-to-end transport service for applications like packetized voice.\n• **IP**: Conceptually in place by the end of the 1970s, IP was separated out of TCP and developed as a separate protocol.\n• **Ethernet**: Developed by Metcalfe and Boggs, Ethernet protocol allowed multiple PCs to share a single broadcast communication medium (a radio frequency).\n• **Internetworking**: Pioneering work on interconnecting networks under DARPA sponsorship led to the development of an encompassing architecture for connecting networks together.",

        "note_content": "• **ARPAnet**: By the end of the 1970s, approximately two hundred hosts were connected to ARPAnet.\n• **Public Internet**: By the end of the 1980s, the number of hosts connected to the public Internet would reach a hundred thousand.\n• **Growth**: The 1980s would be a time of tremendous growth in computer networks linking universities together.\n• **BITNET**: Provided e-mail and file transfers among several universities in the Northeast.\n• **CSNET**: Formed to link university researchers who did not have access to ARPAnet.\n• **NSFNET**: Created to provide access to NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers, starting with an initial backbone speed of 56 kbps and running at 1.5 Mbps by the end of the decade.\n• **TCP/IP**: Officially deployed as the new standard host protocol for ARPAnet on January 1, 1983, replacing NCP protocol.\n• **DNS**: Developed to map between a human-readable Internet name and its 32-bit IP address.\n• **Minitel**: Launched by the French in the early 1980s as an ambitious plan to bring data networking into everyone's home.\n• **X.25 protocol suite**: Used for Minitel, which consisted of public packet-switched network, Minitel servers, and inexpensive terminals with built-in low-speed modems.\n• **Minitel success**: Became a huge success in 1984 when the French government gave away a free Minitel terminal to each French household that wanted one.\n• **Minitel services**: Offered more than 20,000 services at its peak in the mid-1990s, ranging from home banking to specialized research databases.",
